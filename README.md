# Instacart_Basket_Analysis_Python
# Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing Instacart's extensive customer data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that can drive effective marketing strategies. By examining purchasing trends, customer profiles, and ordering behaviors, the analysis seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different customer groups interact with the platform. Key aspects include creating detailed customer profiles based on attributes like age, income, family status, and shopping habits, analyzing order patterns by day and time, and exploring spending behaviors across loyalty groups. The findings aim to enable Instacart to design more targeted marketing campaigns, enhance customer retention, and optimize overall user experience.

# Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.\
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.\
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.\
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.\
● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

# Data
The dataset includes Instacart’s customer and order data, with key components such as:
1. Orders Dataset: Contains information about customer orders, including the day of the week and time of the day the order was placed.
2. Products Dataset: Provides a list of all available products along with their department and aisle assignments.
3. Departments: Details about product departments, categorizing products for further analysis.
4. Customers: Includes demographic and behavioral information such as age, income, dependents, and loyalty status.
5. Merged Dataset: A combined view linking orders, products, and customer profiles for comprehensive analysis.

# Folder Structure
The project files are organized as follows:\
**Project Management:** Contains the Project Brief.\
**Data**: Divided into two subfolders:\
     - **Original Data**: Stores the unaltered raw data frames.\
    - **Prepared Data**: Includes cleaned and processed data frames used for analysis. (Note: Data files are not uploaded to GitHub due to size constraints.)\
**Scripts**: Jupyter notebooks with the code used for analysis.\
**Analysis**: The Visualizations folder contains charts and graphs developed for insights and reporting.\
**Sent to Client**: The final report, delivered in Excel format.

# Disclaimer
Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief were created by CareerFoundry specifically for the purpose of this analysis.
